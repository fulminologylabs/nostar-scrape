3. init_db.sh script from qs_prod (Rust QuickStart)
    - Adapt init_db.sh to Python/Alembic
    - How do we create the DB Schema programmatically with Alembic?
    - Fix FK Constraints on the alembic revision
    - Add indices and confirm unique constraints in the alembic revision 
    - Create models/schemas --> scrap schemas for mapping functions

    - Read: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/basic_relationships.html#basic-relationship-patterns
    - Transitions TextNote Table, Model, Alembic code to Event table
    - Transition EventKind PK to not be AUTO INCREMENT
    - Read about SQLAlchemy ORM: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/

    - For Models and Alembic - Determine whether to use server_default or default
    - Read: https://amercader.net/blog/beware-of-json-fields-in-sqlalchemy/  
     - Examine relationships between job, batch, filter, subscription, and relay 
    - Pre-populate some data (within pipeline) based on filter_handler and job_manager
    - Adapt init_db.sh to spin up a test DB or create independent tests.sh script
    - Ensure tests and fixtures work
    - Determine a test DB setup for now
    - Create CRUD strategy and implement for first involved DB tables: Admin (Relay, Relay Config)
    - Finish making changes to Admin and add tests (add_relay_config, schedule_valid_historical_job)
    *** BOOKMARK ***

    - Implement CRUD strategy for FilterManager (Subscription) and JobManager (Job, potentally New Batch table)

    - Fill out and create tests for all other classes
    - Read enough information from DB to setup examples/historical v0.1 process

    - Establish DB Connection code for the application itself (https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-sqlmodel/)
    - Read about Tornado and explore Async options
    - Read: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/extensions/asyncio.html
    - Determine what type to use for `content` on the Event table
    - Upgrade SQLModel and Alebmic to use async code (https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/cookbook.html)
    - FastAPI for Admin and other functions

4. Write the daily and onboard processes for the scheduler
5. Fix tests
6. Write Relays, Relay Configs, Job Config, Filter Config, Subscription Record Database
7. Logging system
8. Setup equivalent to the Rust CI/CD Pipeline
    - Is there a way to include DB migrations in CI/CD?
9. Tests and Test DB startup script (copy postgres data between 2 schemas; shutdown the test-db after running)
10. Bash Script for tests - catch failed tests and close container
